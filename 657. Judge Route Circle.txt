657. Judge Route Circle

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int ver = 0, hor = 0;
        char[] c = moves.toCharArray();
        for(int i =0; i < c.length; i++){
            if(c[i] == 'U')
                ver++;
            if(c[i] == 'D')
                ver--;
            if(c[i] == 'L')
                hor++;
            if(c[i] == 'R')
                hor--;
        }
        return ver == 0 && hor == 0;
    }
